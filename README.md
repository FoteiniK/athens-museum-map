# Athens museums map Project

Eighth project for Udacity's FEND course.

## Project Overview

In this project, we are asked to use react to develop a single page application featuring a map of a place of our choice. This map has several functionalities,like including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

Athens museums maps diplays a map centered in Athens,with 30 markers which represent 30 museum locations fetched from Foursquare API. There is also a side-menu with all these locations listed. Side menu has a "Search Places" filter option, which filters both the list view and the map markers displayed by default on load. When the user types into the search field, the location list view and the markers update accordingly to filtered results in real time.
Clicking on a marker or a list-item pops up an info window with details about the selected museum. Info Window's content is also fetched from Foursquare API and displays name, image and address of selected place.

#### Credits

This is the final Udacity's FEND project, which combines all the things we have learned the past 9 months. I would like to thank:

- our awesome slack community and my fellow students for their willingness not only to share their knowledge but to also provide endless support and motivation.
- The students who held the study jams and helped us to get a right direction for our projects. Especially the last project's study jam with ms Eman Zaghloul was the one that helped me to set the building foundations for this project.
- the reviewers who reviewed my projects all these months. Every single review taught me new things and made me a better developer.
- Special thank you to my wonderful mentor ms Kelli Blalock for always being there and supported me when I needed help.
